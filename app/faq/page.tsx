        question: "Is ExitDebt a scam?",
        answer: "ExitDebt is a registered debt advisory platform. We don't ask for your bank password. We don't move your money. We only read your credit report to show you where you're overpaying.",
    },
    {
        question: "Will this hurt my CIBIL score?",
        answer: "No. We perform a soft credit check. This has zero impact on your CIBIL score. Only hard inquiries from loan applications affect your score.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is my PAN safe?",
        answer: "Your PAN is hashed instantly using SHA-256. We never store your raw PAN. All data is encrypted with bank-grade AES-256 encryption and auto-deleted after 30 days.",
    },
    {
        question: "Will my bank find out?",
        answer: "No. We only read your credit report from the bureau. Your bank is never contacted or notified. This is completely private.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is there a free trial?",
        answer: "Yes! Every new user gets a free 3-month trial with full access to the debt health dashboard and all 7 intelligence tools. After the trial, you can choose from Lite (₹499/month), Shield (₹1,999/month), or our one-time Settlement service.",
    },

const aboutFaqs = [
    {
        question: "What is debt restructuring?",
        answer: "Debt restructuring is a process where you negotiate with lenders to modify your existing loan terms — typically to lower the interest rate, extend the tenure, or consolidate multiple debts into one manageable EMI. It is a fully legal process recognized by the RBI.",
    },
    {
        question: "How much can I actually save?",
        answer: "It depends on your debt profile. Dashboard users typically save ₹30,000–₹80,000/year through optimized payments. Settlement users can save significantly more — we negotiate directly with creditors to reduce your total outstanding debt.",
    },
    {
        question: "What is a Debt Health Score?",
        answer: "It's a proprietary score (0–100) that measures your overall debt wellness. It considers your debt-to-income ratio, average interest rates, number of active accounts, credit utilization, and payment regularity. Higher is better.",
    },
    {
        question: "What is the Freedom GPS?",
        answer: "Freedom GPS shows you how many months until you're completely debt-free on your current path, and how many months you could save by optimizing your payments. It's your roadmap to ₹0 debt.",
    },
    {
        question: "What happens after I check my debt health?",
        answer: "You'll see your complete dashboard with actionable insights. You can continue with our free trial for 3 months. After that, choose Lite for ongoing dashboard access, Shield for harassment protection and creditor negotiation, or our Settlement service for full debt negotiation.",
    },
